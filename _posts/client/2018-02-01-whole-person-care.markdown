At FJORD I worked with the city of San Francisco’s Department of Public Health and the Mayors Office for Civic Innovation to map the different ways the housing insecure can enroll in Medi-Cal as part of a ongoing program called Whole Person Care.

How we can increase Medi-Cal participation rates of San Francisco’s homeless population.

The Whole Person Care (WPC) was created to increase access to medical services for the housing insecure. Over a five year period 23 million would be put into improving and supporting medical services. Our team was working towards an understanding:

## Field Guide

Early on it had become clear that we were dealing with a very complex and politically charged system. The Enrollment Workers who enroll candidates in MediCal are often caught between multiple systems when trying to enroll indivuals into MediCal. We created a Field Guide so they can focus on helping enroll clients as quickly as possible from their office or street side.

The guide navigate Eligibility Workers through various enrollment challenges and solutions that they may encounter while enrolling a client such as, the process based on enrollment location, myths, forms, common terms, roles across agencies, and frequent roadblocks.

## Mapping Services

One of the most important elements was making sure that the field guide would be editable by the Eligibility Workers in the future as the information is constantly changing and there is a need for one centralized source of truth for HSA, Shelters, Clinics, and Hospitals to relay on for current information. To address this we built our guide on a platform called Gitbook, so that Eligibility Workers can update the guide with new information and publish changes using the GitBook editor.



## Human Services Agency

San Francisco’s Human Services Agency administers benefits frequently used by the homeless such as Medi-Cal, CalFresh, and the County Adult Assistance Program (CAAP). As a result, HSA functions as a hub that other locations such as hospitals, shelters, navigation centers, and behavioral health assistance centers must connect with to ensure Medi-Cal enrollment.

## Behavioral Health Access Centers

As part of the Department of Public Health, BHAC provides a range of mental health and substance abuse services to the homeless. In providing these services, it also serves as a gateway for Medi-Cal enrollment. In addition to BHAC, there are thirty-six total mental health clinics in San Francisco. Twelve of these centers are managed by the city. The other twenty-four are managed by community based organizations (CBOs).

## San Francisco General Hospital

Homeless individuals who are uninsured and require medical assistance often pass through ZSFG. Members of the Health Advocates team as well as ZSFG’s own staff work to find ways to provide health insurance coverage for homeless individuals who access medical services.

Medi-Cal Auto Renewal

Due to complications with how Medi-Cal’s renewal system interacts with CalHEERS, there are opportunities for individuals to be dropped, especially if CalHEERS makes inquiries regarding tax filing status. A manual override requiring supervisor approval needs to be done by an eligibility worker in order to correct this process.

HPE Transition to Medi-Cal

Hospital Presumptive Eligibility (HPE) provides temporary coverage during a maximum two-month period to individuals in a hospital setting who do not have healthcare coverage. HPE can only be used once every 12 months and does not have a direct connection to Medi- Cal enrollment.

BHAC: Information, Identification & Follow-Up

Like other healthcare providers in SF, BHAC provides treatment to individuals regardless of ability to pay. However, the system that clerks and clinicians use to see if individuals are covered does not provide up-to-date information about coverage. There also does not seem to be shared procedures in place to begin enrollment if an individual is identified as not having Medi-Cal.

Perfect Circles: Finding Ways to Connect Agencies

While many locations that we visited had well thought out systems for intake and service access, there are often gaps as individuals move between agencies. Navigators working with the Whole Person Care ethos could help to bridge some of these gaps.
