This year my focus has shifted to doing projects that amplify my learning and help me rebuild my creative confidence. In the spirit of this I have bene looking at setting up a small online store and wanted to research what some of the best options are for indie makers.

|Company|	Free|	Paid|
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| [Small Victories]() |	— |	2.9%  + 30¢|
| [Gumroad]() |	|8.5% + 30¢/sale	$10/mo.|
| [Storenvy]() |	Direct sales|	10%/sale on marketplace|
| [Jimdo]() |	Branded store|	$7.50/mo|
| [Wix]() |	—	|$17/mo.|
| [Weebly]() |	—|	$8/mo. + 3%/sale|
| [ZipSell]() |	—	|$7/mo. + 2.9%  + 30¢|
| [VPRS (Zeit)]() |	—|2.9%  + 30¢|
| [Big Cartel]() |	—	|$9.99/mo|
| [Volusion]() |	—	|$15/mo.|
| [Foxycart]() |	—|	$20/mo. + 15¢/sale|
| [E-junkie]() |	—	|$5/mo.|
| [SendOwl]() |	—	|$9/mo|
| [3dcart]() |	—	|9.99/mo.|

From what I can tell the best starting points are [Zeits VPRS]() and [ZipSell](). Partly because they both use Stripe, and they are both pretty quick to get working if you have some technical experience. But if want to use a GUI the entire way the Small Victories is a reasobable starting pint.
