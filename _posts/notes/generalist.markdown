addd intro

The idea of being a generalist has always been something fantastical to me. The prospect of having a career that required me to explore to learn felt like a perfect way to encourage never-ending growth. The way my younger self thought I could accomplish this was by becoming an interaction designer (IxD). Since at the time it combined my love of making, technology, and learning about other things outside of my field. So, IxD was the clear choice for now.

> Young Human to Designer to Generalist

As a kid, making things, by imitating other things was a way to learn. Because learning was the process of exploration.  In school, it quickly felt like the point was to game the system. Convince the teachers you knew what the text books said down to every word. Even if there was no understanding of the why or how. So the older I got, the less exploration and thus learning took place. Until [college]() where my creativity was reset. In primary education, the focus was on facts from old textbooks instead of learning from what is in the world. But now in college I could look up and observe the world with the lens design. The physical and digital experience were blended into one human-centric experience where everything and anything could be tried and tested. It was a safe place, to safe, in fact, there was almost no connection with the real word at all, and that was great! But transitioning out into the day to day work was so restrictive, it was almost suffocating.

Then six months after graduation any sense of creative freedom was snuffed out. I thought this would be my chance to become a Generalist. But every contract I signed stuck me into a little box and told me to focus on one task. But I was hungry for more, shouldn't now be the best time to learn as much as I can?

> How could I grow if I was told what to make and couldn't look out the window?

So next the focus shifted to learning how non-designer thought I contributed to their field. That has been the past three years, almost as long as I was in school â€” just me learning how to best work with non-designers to make products.

neex mroe fo clonclusrion about why goign to do this an wny its the answer

Think of everything up until this point as a journey in progress, and more exploration through reflection is needed for me to become the generalist. Some topics for future exploration:

- What I expected to learn in design school
- Finding creative freedom
- Design as a Science
- Grounding the Generalist

As a kid I liked making, by imitating the things around me and replicating them. This was because learning was the process of exploration to me and school was well not that. It felt like the point of school was to game the system. So the older I got the less I explored and thus learned until I got to [college](https://cca.edu). This was like a hard reset for my creativity. My primary education told me to focus on facts from old text books instead of learning from what I saw in the world. College reminded me to look up and observe the world with a lens focused through design. The physical and digital experience where blended into one human centric experience where everything and anything could be tried and tested. It was a safe place, to safe, in fact there was almost no connection with the real word at all and that was great! But transitioning out into day to day work was so restrictive. Almost suffocating.
