    "body": "2019/03/25 -            Overview  At CoLab I worked with an in house team to build prototypes for a decentralized messaging protocol called Nomad.    At IDEO CoLab, I worked on Nomad. A platform which uses IPFS to create a peer-to-peer network of nodes that routes messages from publisher to subscriber. Streams are published by nodes which are identified by a public key hash, making Nomad a permission-less system. Anyone can create a new node, subscribe to   existing streams, and publish a stream without signing up for any proprietary service.     Essays  We decided to imagine what would happen if Nomad intervened in the production and transit process of goods between two fisherman, a restaurant, and a shelter. How might we use streaming data to more intelligently consume our available   resources?                            Nomad x Food Production             Current projections indicate that we will extinguish many species of commonly consumed fish by the year 2048. Japan, already close to extinguishing its bluefin tuna population, would surely be one of the first countries to experience the     effects of this mass extinction…                       Nomad x Supply Chains             Supply chains are sets of long branching trees of dependencies worked in tandem to produce a suite of products. Over 770 suppliers, dispersed across the globe, are part of creating Apple's iPhone alone. Properties of the current method of     organization and purchase such as delivery delays, order batching, shortage gaming, and sales and price discounts all contribute to a $30+ billion loss in the grocery supply chain alone.                       Nomad x Home Insurance             The rise of the sharing economy has fueled a system where we can automatically and seamlessly connect with one another and better use our resources. Inevitably, problems come up in a distributed system - from riders who vomit in Ubers to     guests who trash Airbnbs.                 Prototypes  Much of my time was spent working with clients during build sprints to apply an emerging technolgy to the clients market. This typically took place over the course of a week an gave our team the opertinity to use nomad to help us make more   prptypes faster.       Storefront    A logistics platform with networked physical presence — i. e. a network of vending machines. Merchants can bid for slots and enter into Ethereum-based smart contracts.                                MY. ID     An identity management service that allows individuals to create portable, digital, verified identities by leveraging the Know-Your-Customer datasets from their existing financial institutions.           Nomad   CoLab's open source, protocol-level project that enables easy, open information discovery, remixing, composing, and sharing. To demonstrate this we created a table with a map of San Francisco. When you placed a paper clouds on the surface of the table and blocked a solar panel youwould see a signal be sent from the solar panel to a pick plant requesting it sends more energy to the city.           &lt;/div&gt;        Resource:   As a result of weekly build sprints for clients I created example nodes using nomad and common public API's.          CDC    Example node for connecting the CDC API to Nomad     Github Repo          OpenWeather    Example node for connecting Open Weather API to Nomad     Github Repo          Microsoft Traffic    Example node for connecting Microsoft Traffic API to Nomad     Github Repo          Particle    Example node for connecting Particle API to Nomad     Github Repo          Twitter    Example node for connecting Twitter API to Nomad     Github Repo          Instagram    Example node for connecting Instagram API to Nomad     Github Repo          Yahoo Weather    Example node for connecting Yahoo Weather API to Nomad Github Repo          511     Example node for connecting California's 511 system to Nomad     Github Repo      "

    "body": "2018/01/31 - At FJORD I worked with the city of San Francisco’s Department of Public Health and the Mayors Office for Civic Innovation to map the different ways the housing insecure can enroll in Medi-Cal as part of a ongoing program called Whole Person Care. How we can increase Medi-Cal participation rates of San Francisco’s homeless population. The Whole Person Care (WPC) was created to increase access to medical services for the housing insecure. Over a five year period 23 million would be put into improving and supporting medical services. Our team was working towards an understanding: Field Guide: Early on it had become clear that we were dealing with a very complex and politically charged system. The Enrollment Workers who enroll candidates in MediCal are often caught between multiple systems when trying to enroll indivuals into MediCal. We created a Field Guide so they can focus on helping enroll clients as quickly as possible from their office or street side. The guide navigate Eligibility Workers through various enrollment challenges and solutions that they may encounter while enrolling a client such as, the process based on enrollment location, myths, forms, common terms, roles across agencies, and frequent roadblocks. Mapping Services: One of the most important elements was making sure that the field guide would be editable by the Eligibility Workers in the future as the information is constantly changing and there is a need for one centralized source of truth for HSA, Shelters, Clinics, and Hospitals to relay on for current information. To address this we built our guide on a platform called Gitbook, so that Eligibility Workers can update the guide with new information and publish changes using the GitBook editor. Human Services Agency: San Francisco’s Human Services Agency administers benefits frequently used by the homeless such as Medi-Cal, CalFresh, and the County Adult Assistance Program (CAAP). As a result, HSA functions as a hub that other locations such as hospitals, shelters, navigation centers, and behavioral health assistance centers must connect with to ensure Medi-Cal enrollment. https://sf-wpc. gitbooks. io/fieldguide/content/assets/blueprint_hsa. pdf Behavioral Health Access Centers: As part of the Department of Public Health, BHAC provides a range of mental health and substance abuse services to the homeless. In providing these services, it also serves as a gateway for Medi-Cal enrollment. In addition to BHAC, there are thirty-six total mental health clinics in San Francisco. Twelve of these centers are managed by the city. The other twenty-four are managed by community based organizations (CBOs). https://sf-wpc. gitbooks. io/fieldguide/content/assets/blueprint_bhac. pdf San Francisco General Hospital: Homeless individuals who are uninsured and require medical assistance often pass through ZSFG. Members of the Health Advocates team as well as ZSFG’s own staff work to find ways to provide health insurance coverage for homeless individuals who access medical services. https://sf-wpc. gitbooks. io/fieldguide/content/assets/blueprint_sfgh. pdf Medi-Cal Auto Renewal Due to complications with how Medi-Cal’s renewal system interacts with CalHEERS, there are opportunities for individuals to be dropped, especially if CalHEERS makes inquiries regarding tax filing status. A manual override requiring supervisor approval needs to be done by an eligibility worker in order to correct this process. HPE Transition to Medi-Cal Hospital Presumptive Eligibility (HPE) provides temporary coverage during a maximum two-month period to individuals in a hospital setting who do not have healthcare coverage. HPE can only be used once every 12 months and does not have a direct connection to Medi- Cal enrollment. BHAC: Information, Identification &amp; Follow-Up Like other healthcare providers in SF, BHAC provides treatment to individuals regardless of ability to pay. However, the system that clerks and clinicians use to see if individuals are covered does not provide up-to-date information about coverage. There also does not seem to be shared procedures in place to begin enrollment if an individual is identified as not having Medi-Cal. Perfect Circles: Finding Ways to Connect Agencies While many locations that we visited had well thought out systems for intake and service access, there are often gaps as individuals move between agencies. Navigators working with the Whole Person Care ethos could help to bridge some of these gaps. "

    "body": "2017/07/29 -    In June of 2017 I lead user research phase to determine the viability for a new product called Maker Platform. Established and managed the first community of makers who used IFTTT. Documented and developed case studies to determine how   IFTTT’s products could evolve to better match the demand of IOT and affiliated systems. Included is a selected set of work.   Intro  During my two month contract with IFTTT I worked with the Platform team and Marketing team to research a new tool which was being released to makers called the Maker Platform. The tools was a variant of what was offered to IFTTT partners like   Nest, Microsoft, etc. with a few modifications. The goal was to research the product with an alpha and beta testing community as it was in active development.            Research          During the research phase I conducted research interviews to determine how makers, individuals who created their own Applets on ifttt. com, currently used the platform and what we could do to allow them to make even more awesome Applets.      After interviewing participants over a course of a few weeks I created a research readout to act as a summary of findings form internal and external user research, secondary research, FullStory sessions, and ongoing community engagement     with the Maker Platform Beta. Below I have included selected assets from the research.                       Evolution of IFTTT FORMULA   Many alternatives to IFTTT have focused on features as IFTTT has focused on building a network of services users love. This particular project focused on providing and building some of “expected features” back into the IFTTT platform. There    was a need to highlight the evolution of the IFTTT formula as part of the research identified a need to contextualize where the IF This Then That formula started and where it is going in order to understand the needed infrastructure to    support users.                    Anatomy of an Applet   Applets can be thought of in four levels of complexity and three ways of manipulation.                 Layer One - Summary of the function of the Applet    Layer Two - Summary of the function and the state of the Applet    Layer Three - Selector for customizations and notifications     Layer Four - Composition layer where you can create Applets using Triggers, Filters, and Actions                                 Build      Phase two focused on building out the next version of the Maker platform.

Built on IPFS, a distributed network, Nomad is engineered as universal infrastructure: to be open, scalable, and durable. Anyone can create a new node, subscribe to existing streams, and publish a stream without signing up for any proprietary service.  To learn more about Nomad, visit getnomad. io. Supply chains are sets of long branching trees of dependencies worked in tandem to produce a suite of products. Over 770 suppliers, dispersed across the globe, are part of creating Apple’s iPhone alone. Properties of the current method of organization and purchase such as delivery delays, order batching, shortage gaming, and sales and price discounts all contribute to a $30+ billion loss in the grocery supply chain alone. This fundamentally is problem of coordination, exacerbated by consumer data being siloed at the varying points of sale. As the chain get longer, the latency of information between the retailers and each link becomes greater and turnaround time slows. Longer supply chains are much less resilient and adaptable. Each link in the supply chain uses their own algorithm to predict demand based on the fuzzier and fuzzier data as it gets closer and closer to the roots of the supply chain. In a supply chain, each step of production is one step further from consumer demand. This distortion leads to excessive inventory throughout the system, poor product forecasts, insufficient or excessive capacities, product unavailability, and higher costs generally as the global game of telephone goes awry… …until Nomad. We were intrigued by this problem, and wrote the following narrative to imagine how Nomad might help a boutique San Diego brewery investigate demand, iterate on their current product offerings with available resources, and swiftly respond to demand.  Bill, the chief brewer and owner of the Havoc Craft Brewing Company in San Diego, arrives on the brewing floor and walks over to his production monitors. As the screens blink to life, Bill looks over the monthly report on the sales of the three beers currently brewed by Havoc. He has noticed that sales for their current product offerings has been dropping steadily for the past few months and decides to subscribe to a Nomad atomic node that scrubs Twitter for any mentions of his brand and subsequent beers for positive and/or negative feedback. His dashboard displays trending sentiments within the scrubbed tweets: highlights including multiple references of #havocbeer being “unambitious”, “forgettable”, and “underwhelming”. Feeling down but not out, Bill’s curiosity about current beer trends peaks, he searches the Nomad discover platform for a composite node that culls sales data from local pubs, grocery stores, and boutique retailers to find growing trends in beer consumption. Quickly importing the data to his dashboard, Bill sees that the San Francisco area, one of the most competitive and profitable regions for beer sales, has seen a spike in desire for Double IPAs with fruity notes. Havoc beer doesn’t currently brew any Double IPAs and Bill has always wanted to experiment with fruit in the brewing process.  Inspired and empowered, Bill makes his way to the stockroom. He knows that Double IPAs require twice as much malt and three times as many hops as a typical lager, so he checks through his digitized grind sheets that parse Havoc’s current inventory of hops, yeast, and malt. sensors gauge the weight of each set of ingredients and display that he should have enough ingredients to make a few trial batches. While Bill has all the ingredient to make a basic Double IPA, there isn’t any fruit to add into the production beer wort. If this beer is to be successful in the competitive landscape, they are going to need the finest ingredients.  Bill subscribes to a Nomad node that displays the current fruit harvest at orchards nearby. The node consistently streams updates, and Bill finds that a farm in Moorpark, CA has just had an unexpectedly abundant harvest of heirloom apricots and is willing to let them go for a fraction of the usual cost per pound. Bill calls the farm and places an order for 200 pounds of their sweetest apricots. After confirming the sale, the small farm is quick to respond to Havoc’s order and sends GPS tagged crates to the brewing company loading bay. Over the next few days, Bill and his crew dries bitter malt knowing that the sweet apricots will balance the sugar levels in the wort further down the production line. Hardware sensors monitor and optimize the temperature of the cracking process based on Nomad data for his specific ingredient set, brewing floor conditions, and the level of moisture in the air. As Bill pours the malt into the mash drums, the brewing status of Havoc Brewing’s new Apricotastrophe Double IPA is published on their website, promoting the beer, as dynamic advertisements display an intimate view at the brewing process as well as a message publishing an ETA to “bars near you!” — promoting engagement with fans and accumulating hype will be imperative to a successful launch; it is craft beer after all.  After the finishing touches on fermentation, packaging, bottling are carried out, Bill’s heart beats with excitement as he repurposes the GPS crates he received the apricots in and re-tags them with the shipping data for the first introductory batch and flags the crate for pickup. In the coming weeks, Bill monitors the distribution of Apricotastrophe to local bars, pubs, and corner stores as the shipping crates publish location data, as well as sun exposure, temperature, and quality of handling. If any crates receive undesirable shipping conditions that may spoil or taint the beer, the batch is flagged as subpar and not distributed to consumers. It is crucial that the first experiences of consumers is as pleasurable as possible and wholly unaffected by conditions outside of Havoc’s purview, especially as they would deter prospective customers, erode their brand name, and ruin the new product’s prospect of success.  As the first crates arrive in the market, hardware sensors on kegs monitor consumption. They publish their data, and the the monitors on Havoc’s brewing floor subscribe. If the bar or pub has enabled automatic reordering, a new keg is automatically shipped as soon as an old one is getting low. This enables a shorter turnaround as product demand can be received and acted upon immediately instead of relying on supply chain politics. Bill and his crew gather around to watch as their creation meets the public. Within the day, Havoc has received an onslaught of new orders and reorders for Apricotastrophe as sales spike and social media posts pour in favoring their new offering. The crew cracks open some beers as Bill creates his own Nomad composite node to link a tapped keg with the ordering of new ingredients to any of their various produce suppliers. He sits back and relaxes in front of the brewing floor monitors as his team continues working on what they do best — brewing beer.  With Bill’s supply chain backed by the power of Nomad, he has the ability to now bring the bullwhip effect under his control. He can see what consumers downstream are doing — helping him develop new products and order more ingredients. The future of supply chains has unified understanding of consumer’s data as it gets broadcast from its source to ensure that all stakeholders are able to work fully in sync saving money, time, and resources.

The rise of the sharing economy has fueled a system where we can automatically and seamlessly connect with one another and better use our resources. Inevitably, problems come up in a distributed system — from riders who vomit in Ubers to guests who trash Airbnbs. Today, our risk management systems rely primarily on human judgment in parsing through different, biased accounts of an incident, and little by way of unbiased, real-time data. t’s difficult, if not impossible, to prove what happened when things go wrong and take corrective action… …until Nomad. The following narrative is a short depiction how Nomad might support an AirBnB host by monitoring their appliances and valuables, advocating on their behalf if a breakage or misuse occurs, and ensuring comprehensive accountability, coverage, and repair. Let’s take someone like Kate, who leases her apartment on platforms like Airbnb and HomeAway when she travels. Kate lives at her place most of the year, and uses short term rentals as a way to help keep the cost of her mortgage manageable. Kate lives in a “smart home” — nearly all of the elements of her home are connected. She’s got sensors in the fridge, measuring temperature, weight of goods and what’s inside. She has sensors on her water heater, her radiator, showerhead, television, and even her locks. The sensors measure everything from what’s in use to what’s worn down or needs replacement. In Kate’s home, all of the sensors that sit on top of her goods are set up as Nomad atomic nodes, quietly publishing to a composite node that aggregates the information and publishes a report on 4121 Maple Drive every five minutes that notes any unusual changes or breakages. When Kate leases her home on Airbnb, the atomic node that connects to her Airbnb account parses the information and publishes it to the 4121 Maple Drive composite sensor. That way, when the guest arrives, changes in the house’s appliances and item status are aggregated and tagged with the guest’s name. Most of the time, the sensors just sit in Kate’s home, fairly passively publishing information. Kate makes a mental note to look at the report every month or so to get ahead of any maintenance or work required. Her insurance company even gave her a major break on her home insurance costs, since subscribing to Kate’s composite node let them price risk much more granularly. Now, instead of paying a fixed fee every month, Kate’s payment fluctuates within a certain band depending on the choices she’s made to keep her home in tip top shape and rewarding her for her efforts. Her composite node definitely came in handy last spring when Kate leased her home out to a group of guys who were hosting a bachelor party. Her guests ended up breaking her hot tub by trying to fit too many people inside and pushing the heating knob beyond its safety lock. Before she’d connected her home to the Nomad platform, Kate might not have discovered the broken hot tub until she next went to use it — perhaps months later. It would have been hard to prove that the guests were responsible, and Kate would have struggled to get either her insurance company or Airbnb’s to pay out. Instead, the moment the hot tub pressure sensors identified that thresholds were exceeded, her home’s composite node highlighted that risk. When the composite node received the information on the broken knob, it published another report. And when the hot tub cooled, even while the knob was turned, the composite node published a third update. Airbnb, who subscribes to Kate’s composite node, had invested in an algorithm that evaluated the reports published by composite nodes to identify any harm done unto a user’s belongings. The company immediately triggered an email to Kate: Hey! Looks like your guests may have broken your hot tub. We’ve scheduled a repairman to come out and fix it next week, and we’ll hold the guests’ security deposit until then. Not to worry Kate — we’ve got your back! Risk algorithms suggested that this would probably only be part of the damage. Upon the composite node alert, Airbnb began to listen to some of the other sensors in Kate’s home — like the air quality sensors, that were detecting high levels of organic matter that matched marijuana, and her Roomba, which was picking up much higher than normal volumes of dirt and mud. Identifying that the home would likely need a deep clean, Airbnb automatically scheduled an additional cleaning crew to arrive at the close of the reservation, and charged the group for the costs. Airbnb’s insurance immediately got a copy of the composite node data and the triggered subscriptions. Because of the sensor evidence from Kate’s home, the insurance company didn’t need to waste time manually processing her claim, sifting through the guests’ accounts and Kate’s and likely being unable to find in Kate’s favor. Instead, they were able to easily and automatically resolve Kate’s issues without an adversarial confrontation. For Kate, having a smart home equipped with Nomad sensors has been invaluable. Not only has it been helpful to know when and what needs to be repaired, and to be rewarded for her proactivity, but it makes participating in the sharing economy feel so much easier, simpler, and fairer. Kate can rely on her home’s information to trigger the best possible resolution to issues, making her trust the systems and platforms she interacts with even more.

Current projections indicate that we will extinguish many species of commonly consumed fish by the year 2048. Japan, already close to extinguishing its bluefin tuna population, would surely be one of the first countries to experience the effects of this mass extinction… …until Nomad. We decided to imagine what would happen if Nomad intervened in the production and transit process of goods between two fisherman, a restaurant, and a shelter. How might we use streaming data to more intelligently consume our available resources? Before first light, a Hawaiian fisherman named Aukai **pulls out his iPad and reviews the day’s fishing projections. Scrolling through his dashboard, powered by Nomad, he looks at inventory requests streamed from local restaurants and the bounties placed on their desired stock. Short cables are detached as he and his crew set out along the crimson horizon to find today’s catch Pulling data collected by FishTracker, a product that uses the Nomad protocol to the track the movement and population of fish in off the coast of Canada, Aukai uses a navigates to where the highest yields of Yellowfin Tuna might be today.  As Aukai and his crew pull in the first nets from the water and onto the starboard deck, he quickly discovers that the FishTracker projections were correct. The fish flop onto the deck as weight sensors monitor the size of the catch, which is automatically published to the boat’s “Fishing Stock” Nomad Node. Carrying the fish down to the freezers below deck, Aukai **receives a notification on his Nomad Dashboard from the boat’s load centers that he is almost at capacity for today’s catch. Though the crew caught a large number of Yellowfin Tuna, they also pulled in a fair number of Peacock Groupers and Blacktail Snappers.  The Ono Grill — a beachfront restaurant — prepares their menu as a manager checks the “Aggregate Fishing Stock” Nomad Composite Node to see what fish boats pulled in earlier that morning. Reviewing the amount of Yellowfin Tuna caught by the fishermen and then checking their stockroom, it becomes clear that the restaurant will not have enough tuna for their famous Ahi Tuna Tartare. Determined to stock up before the dinner rush, the Ono Grill **places a bounty on tuna and publishes it to the network, hoping that it will be picked up another fisherman at sea.  William, another local fisherman out on the water hoping to find some halibut, is instead surprised to find some tuna which had migrated north to warmer water. Pulling in his catch onto the deck, an onboard camera streams a video feed of the unexpected catch and broadcasts his haul on Nomad. A composite node leverages artificial intelligence and parses the video feed data, determining that the fish William pulled in is in fact Yellowfin Tuna. Moments later, William’s phone vibrates with news of the bounty placed by The Ono Grill. Halfway to fulfilling it, William decides to clean the bounty by catching the extra tuna needed by the restaurant.  A local food bank plans out their dinner menu for the following evening and notices that this week’s offerings have been notably reliant on poultry dishes. In order to mix up their offerings, they place a bounty for fish to the “Excess Fish Stock” Nomad Node — a stream subscribed to by many local Hawaiian restaurants that want contribute their excess stock to peripheral shelters in need.  As the Ono Grill feeds its last customers and begins to close shop, a manager notices that the restaurant now has an overabundance of tuna in the stockroom. Taking a look at the customer data broadcast to Nomad throughout the day, the manager sees that they had lower customer turnout than was expected for the evening and sold less Ahi Tuna Tartare than they had projected. The Ono Grill’s excess fish stock is logged and published to Nomad to be viewed by local food banks and shelters in the area.  After reviewing several bounties for their excess stock, the Ono Grill **decides to send their extra tuna to the local Food Bank and claims the bounty published on Nomad. After the bounty is claimed, the Food Bank becomes notified of the available fish, prepares for the incoming shipment, and revises the menu for tomorrow’s dinner. Nomad takes what was the fragmented system, with parties that rely on one another to make ends meet, and unifies their education by sharing realtime data. A fisherman — like Aukai — can understand how to maximize time fishing based on data collected by Nomad from other fishermen, and identify supply and demand through bounties put out by restaurants. Another fisherman — like William — is able to access data from fishermen about specific yields to avoid overfishing specific populations as well as receive bounties in the field to help equalize cost and demand. A restaurant — like the Ono Grill — can gain holistic access the type of produce available. A shelter — like the local food bank — can receive excess food, before it goes bad, to reduce their overhead and increase quality of goods served.

The following narrative is a short depiction how Nomad might leverage real-time data to uncover insights about an urban locale and identify valuable development opportunities. City Supervisor Rebecca Knope has been having a rough morning. The long bus ride from the Richmond district is always an uncomfortable experience. She gets her usual cup of coffee before a walking into City Hall. She thinks about all of the zoning and development issues to address today, as her assistant greets her and lets her know that there is a contractor waiting for her to talk about undeveloped properties on the waterfront. Rebecca can’t help but think about how many more visits she gets regarding renovation and development since the city started publishing their data on Nomad nodes on the Nomad discovery platform. Greeting the young developer, Rebecca opens up her laptop and looks up the new Cityview Management software, built to collate data off of Nomad atomic nodes in cities. “Nice to meet you Jessica, so what brings you in today?” Rebecca says as she offers out her hand. “Nice to meet you as well Supervisor Knope. I am here to discuss Piers 27 and 28 along the Embarcadero. Based off of data from Cityview, we’ve concluded that there is profound opportunity to renovate and renew these properties for commercial and office use. I have brought a draft proposal today that outlines what we would like to do with the space and what retrofits we can make to make the space eligible for re-zoning. ” “What exactly has brought you to this investment conclusion? The data here is promising but I would like to hear your reasoning. ” Jessica swiftly opens a data projection file in Cityview and turns the computer so Rebecca can see it. “I’m glad you asked. Based off of foot traffic data collected on city sensors on street lamps and purchase data around the area in local shops, there is already a massive opportunity for commercial space. The ferry building is a good precedent for this. On top of this, most of the purchases are made by cards associated with zip codes out of state, meaning that many of these pedestrians are tourists. ” Jessica spoke quickly as she scrolled through the data. “That only explains part of your proposal though, why would there be any reason for office space in these lots? After all most business won’t invest into placing assets over water like this…” Rebecca pointed out. Jessica quickly navigated to different part of Cityview, showing different types of businesses in the area. “Great point! But the city occupancy node shows some interesting things about how current use of piers works. This data paired with some research on what businesses actually operate on the piers shows that business with lots of human assets that move in and out of the space and grow quickly would be happy to lease out office space here. In fact there are already interested clients! A number of startups vying for space, but the design firm IDEO is willing to move in as soon as the space is renovated, I think they want more room for a studio of theirs, something called the CoLab. Based on the real time data and the demographics of space usage in the surrounding area I am sure we can find business that are perfectly happy to occupy a pier. ” Rebecca looked over the proposal. “Well, you have been very thorough. Are you just looking at these two properties today?” she asked. Jessica looked over her Cityview application and considered the question. “Well to be honest since the data went live last month we have begun building a number of proposals. Your real time crime data has given us a lot of insight into how the Tenderloin is changing and what kinds of developments might thrive, and we might be interested in bringing you a proposal about a couple of properties near Van Ness Street. ” Jessica explained. Rebecca looked through a mandate she recently received from the mayor as she listened. “Well, I am excited to hear you are interested in investing more in the city. Still, I feel I should inform you that we are going start using the City view Neighborhood data to make some more granular requirements for multi-use buildings. If you want to develop in the Tenderloin on the east side of Van Ness, you will have to include zoned space for homeless relief and urban farming. Based of the reduced crime rates, we know it’s becoming desirable, but foot traffic sensors show that there are still a lot of underserved people. Based off of our purchase data from stores in the area, there is very little affordable fresh food for these people. If you want to build there, you are going to have to help us solve this food desert. ” Jessica was taking notes as Rebecca spoke. “Well, thank you very much for telling me. I don’t think this will greatly impact our decision and we are excited to revitalize this part of San Francisco. On the matter of the piers… will you support our proposal and hand it to the Mayor?” Rebecca smiled, “Get me a final draft and I’d be happy to lend my support to it. ” As Rebecca walked the developer to the door she thought about how the city might change because of the real-time information now available to everyone. San Francisco has long been a city of change, but with Cityview, powered by Nomad, the Supervisors and Mayor can start to specifically direct that change, in ways valuable to all.

    "body": "2015/12/31 - I have vivid memories growing up of battling the covenant online in halo and video chatting with family across the country. Over time this love has perpetually grown as my bandwidth has increased from 64KB/s to 120MB/s. Recently, I have taken my data footprint to a new scale by cutting the cord and automating my life with services like IFTTT and Evernote. Despite all of this joy between the internet and me, we have an unhealthy relationship and we need to have an intervention. The cost of ♥️. There have been two major events causing me to question my relationship with the internet. One has been my coursework at California College of the Arts that addresses various aspects of sustainability. The second has been reading the May 2015 Greenpeace Click Clean Report, which focuses on evaluating the nation’s largest data centers based on the methods they use to power themselves. I began to connect the dots. Sure, driving a car has an impact. We even rate them based on mpg. But what could the effect of all this data really be on our wonderful little planet? Where do I even start? Let’s begin with T-Mobile, my cellular provider. It turns out the iPhone automatically tracks my data usage down to the application. So, for my current roaming period I have used about 40GB. But what is the impact of the 40GB? Next, I investigated how much I use at home which should be the bulk of my usage. My Internet Service Provider (ISP), Comcast, also tracks that for me. Now I wanted to average these numbers being that September was exceptionally high which would bring my average usage to 3,300GB per month. So how many pounds of CO2 are released on average for 1 GB of data? Gigabytes to CO2 I don’t know that we can be faulted for our addiction to the internet but we need to be made more aware of the impact. Yes, there are many ways in which the internet contributes to our society. Sociologically speaking products like Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat have redefined how we communicate with each other as humans. Economically, Google, Amazon, and Kickstarter have changed how we purchase products from anywhere in the world. Yet, ecologically we need to grapple with the environmental impact of the internet and make clear improvements. I read an article by Justin Secor called The Web is inefficient, but we can fix it and calculated the impact 1GB of data had in terms of CO2 assuming that all data centers are created equal. My findings were that 1GB of hosted data creates about 2 lbs of CO2 per month released into the atmosphere. 1 GB = 2 LBS CO2 Given that my cumulative monthly data usage is 40GB+3,300GB= 3,340GB that would mean that I aid in generating 6,680lbs CO2 per month on average. This suggests that my digital footprint pollutes about 80,160 lbs CO2 per year. A 💔 The idea of our data living in the ‘cloud’ is a positive though misleading metaphor. That’s not the reality in which we live. All of those little bytes streaming through fiberoptic cables across the globe to get us the new Adele song do have a quantifiable cost beyond your monthly bill. I want to maintain my relationship with the internet but we need to push for more stringent requirements in evaluating these data centers and the products which they host. Greenpeace, for the last couple of years, has begun to evaluate data centers and give them a grade based on their Transparency, Energy Efficiency &amp; Mitigation, Renewable Energy Deployment &amp; Advocacy, and Renewable Energy Commitment &amp; Siting Policy. LEED also certifies data centers, but only certifies the building itself. We need to go further, we must go futher. When the time comes for economics to push for a sustainable means of running data centers it will be too late. We cannot wait until we are out of coal or petroleum. We need to act now. An Intervention I am not going to stop using the internet, nor is it realistic to think that we should, but there is a necessary level of awareness and action that needs to be taken to prevent our consumption from ravaging our planet. We need to make it more sustainable by setting standards by which we can regulate data centers now and in the future. A portion of this advancement will naturally happen because of routine developments in technology; however, we still need to put standards in place to help propel future technologies in the right direction. Research I want to create a platform that centralizes the researching on how data is stored and consumed to build a more sustainable computing network. Sustainability always becomes more complicated then I anticipate. So naturally my current project in “IxD 5: Sustainability” discovered that one of the most difficult parts was simply describing the ecosystem surounding my topic, data. I think this is partially due to the misleading notion that our ‘data’ lives in the ‘cloud’. So I created this simplified flow to breakdown how data flows from the data center to your device. Key data points from Greenpeace Data from greenpeace-clicking-clean-2015. silk. co Data from greenpeace-clicking-clean-2015. silk. coWhere to focus Means of evaluation Feedback Concept Feedback It would be nice if the organization did not turn into just another government entity (It is not clear if you are proposing that it would or wouldn’t be. ) We are still run like a start up so we are scrappy which means the cheapest and best MVP wins overtime. Our culture cares about being aware of how we make an impact, but we are still driven by the need to make enough money to survive. Looking at the breakdown, we would definitely fit into the current means of evaluation. My fear is that as we begin to scale and take on companies like Amazon, we will continue to be scrappy but will fail of the proposed regulations because we are the underdog trying to take on a behemoth. Could you add a category for legacy hardware. (We recycle our old drives and reuse the hardware. ) Future Points of Influence. The only reason we would be inclined is because we are small and scrappy so portions of your proposal already fit in our current work flow. Backblaze would heavily judge if they wanted to participate based on the other companies validating or backing the program. If this is a LEED extension program for example, we might be more inclined. Could this platform focus more on showcasing good practices so we can use our collective knowledge to build better data facilities. Think of it as crowd sourcing knowledge. Crowd sourcing knowledge could create an expectation for better standards in terms of influence. In the beginning other companies thought Backblaze was cheating because no one thought of a way to optimize storage because no one could understand we were charging what we were and actually making money.

    "body": "2015/12/31 - Enable heirlooms to act as vessels for memories that connect generations. RESEARCH Memory is a tricky thing. It is fragile, robust, and meaningful. We often lack appreciation of memories in the moment, only to find them important in the years ahead. These reasons are part of what motivated me to examine how we could use a garment to expand and share our memory. The process for this project was heavily inspired by the relationship that I have with my grandparents who used to live in California where I currently reside. I realized I knew very little about when they lived here and what they did. When I started exploring memory, I immediately recalled a talk that I heard from Wilson Miner from the Build 2011 conference in which he discusses objects being vessels for memory. As I researched the meaning behind objects, curiosity was sparked in the relationship between heirlooms and totems. These are often the names we give to belongings that are more meaningful to us than everyday objects. They are the things that we keep near and the things that help us remember. There is a special relationship in how we interact with these objects. Some we keep safely locked away, some we cannot help but hold near, and often they help us to share stories of the past with others. DESIGN PRINCIPLES Warmth - The final form should convey the feeling of snuggling up with a good book next to a warm fire. Safe and Secure - The garment should create a safe-feeling user environment. Intimate - The experience should enable a level of intimacy in order to allow the wearer to reflect on personal moments without judgement. Handmade - The craft behind the garment should have a story, both to act as a starting point for the keeping of memories but also to showcase the handmade craft that adds character to an object. Personal - The garment should act as a totem, something that holds particular meaning to that individual and something that he or she feels can be passed along to other specific individuals, but not just anybody. PROTOTYPES One of the first concepts combined audio recording with geo location by embedding them both into a scarf. This scarf could be switched between modes. The modes include a record mode or explore mode. The second iteration focused on a scarf-hoodie combination in which the same two modes would exist and would be linked to the hood being up and the hood being down. The shift in form was primarily due to trying to amplify the feeling of warmth and intimacy by creating an environment which allowed you to feel semi-isolated anywhere. After testing both variations of the muslin prototypes and interviewing individuals on the surrounding eco-systems, I determined that the ability to record based on location did not need to be combined; rather, the functions should be able to work independently of one another. Although the ability to receive information based on a specific location still interests me, my focus shifted to honing the experience between recording and playing back audio. This way the focus can be drawn to the meaning behind the content. NEXT STEPS Explore possibility for a surrounding ecosystem. Consider what other forms of technology could be used more subtly and effectively. Try varying the triggering mechanisms for recording and playing back. Conduct additional user testing to determine best methods for interacting with content beyond sound.

In the beginning radio was purely meant to be used as a communication tool. From there it evolved into one of the main ways we listened to music and learned about the news as families would gather around to listen. Once radio was replaced by the television, it found a new home in our cars and for a brief time even on our phones. Since then, radio has taken many forms, including apps for public radio stations, billboard chart lists, YouTube shows and Podcasts. Today, radio is in the midst of rebranding its identity. Given the expansion of radio in multiple forms, I wanted to explore what it would mean to (re)personalize the radio while taking it back to its roots of storytelling in a communal setting. LEARNINGS Media - Media should manage itself; you should not be managed by media. Form - The content should be customized for the end user. The Broadcast - The speaker should require so little interaction that it operates independently. The Object - The object should reflect the personality of the individual but not distract from the content. PROTOTYPING PROTOTYPE 01 The first iteration focused on creating a form which was mobile enough that you could take it to a room for a party but large enough that it was not practical to take out of a house. The end shape was too cumbersome to reflect the main control mechanism to rotate the device in order to change broadcasts. PROTOTYPE 02 The second iteration was primarily an exploration of form in which the device could comfortably be rotated with one hand. PROTOTYPE 03 Prototype number 3 was another refinement of the physical volume of the device as well as determining the proper weight and textures to refine the control mechanisms. Screens Updated post project. NEXT STEPS Explore a wider variation of forms. Complete a deep dive into a second round of research specifically on how people consume audio based media content. Investigate how communal conversation can be generated around the syncing of the broadcasting of the device among multiple users or by altering the methods of content distribution.

    "body": "2015/05/05 - From The Analogue State to the Digital State Like it or not, technology has become part of our daily lives. An increasing number of people around the world, in countries rich and poor, own devices that we use daily, be it a tablet, smart phone or computer. These devices allow us, in theory, to communicate, organize our days, stay connected, and be more productive. This theory that devices help rather than hinder us is a subject of debate. Through my major and field of Interaction Design, I have studied how humans interact with everything from technology to household products and even varied life experiences. Given my area of study, I am intrigued by the theory that screens, apps, and social media enhance our lives as I question how well the average human is doing in managing all of it.  I share the questions and concerns arising in media and everyday discourse regarding the connection between the increased use of different platforms and devices to stay organized and connected and whether we, as individuals and potentially a society, have become increasingly distracted, disconnected, and less productive in the process. A quintessential paradigm shift within technology exists with the transition from a landline to a smart phone.  It is difficult to believe that as recently as 15 years ago the vast majority of American households had a landline installed in their home.  If no one was home at the time to take a call, one would most likely have an answering machine attached to the phone where one could hear the missed messages. The phone did not follow us; rather, it stayed in the house and waited for calls to come in. This all started to change with the introduction of the cellular phone, which originated in 1992 and was invented by IBM. Through the years these new phones evolved dramatically with the largest shift occurring in 2007 with the invention of the iPhone.  Suddenly, we held a veritable computer in our hands. (Ozgur 2011) The innovation of these devices then caused a dramatic shift in consumer demand for landlines. Today, over 40 percent of households have dropped their landline phones, with the percentage growing everyday. (Channick 2014) Wilson Miner, a digital product designer in San Francisco, states, “to get to a user base of 50 million users, it took radio 40 years, the television 10 years, the iPhone 3 years and you-tube 6 months. ” (Minor 2011) We see what could be best described as an exponential increase in the interest and purchase of a smart phone compared to past technologies. Multiple reasons drive this. For instance, they are eminently portable, providing access to email, websites, calendars, photos and live communication with our friends and family at a moment’s notice. Smart phones also provide access to innumerable apps to download based on our personal needs. There are over 60,000 apps added to the Apple App Store each month. (Unknown Author 2014) These applications run the gamut of helping us organize, calendar, read, play, socialize, entertain, and search the internet.  One could easily conclude that consumers are on overload purely with the number of choices they currently have when it comes to apps; who has the time to review thousands of apps just to find one good one? And, just when you think you have the best app possible for a calendar, a new one comes out that you must get and try out to see if it is indeed better. Another device that most of us own or have access to is a computer. The computer was invented long before the smart phone, but what has been a game changer has been mobile computing. This new technology allowed a smart phone to now communicate with the computer.  So, if we receive mail on our computer, we could now receive it on our phone. If we had a calendar on our computer, we could now view it on our smart phone. Mobile computing connected our two devices to talk with one another. This was one of the reasons the smart phone became and remains so popular. Add in the innovation that has occurred with the computer and you get devices like tablets, iPad’s, laptops, and other portable devices that can be taken with us anywhere to keep us connected. In just a matter of years, 42 percent of all Americans now own a tablet. (Zickuhr and Lee 2014) With this huge shift in portability of devices, one can discern that it is harder to have an off button. Thirty years ago the number of ways to contact an individual at home was very limited; short of stopping by in person one’s main alternative was the phone.  Now, for many people they could be contacted by myriad methods all in a matter of moments throughout the day, from text and social media, to email and whatever the latest online fad might be. Social scientists should continue to ask some serious questions about what it means for humans to constantly take in such a high level of input. The underlying assumption to much of marketing for technology is that we become better, more connected people with the innovation at our fingertips. Tim Kreider from the New York Times notes, “Busyness serves as a kind of existential reassurance, a hedge against emptiness; obviously your life cannot possibly be silly or trivial or meaningless if you are so busy, completely booked, in demand every hour of the day. ” (Sacks 2013) So, does this advanced technology feeds our egos more than it feeds our souls? Do we find relief from life’s anxieties through the ritual of distraction, found in abundance within the apps of a smartphone? And, if so, is this appearance of connection with individuals and the world simply superficial, actually imposing roadblocks to the kind of deeper, meaningful connection that used to define human communities? Instead of being left in awe by the latest technological wonder, we would do well to consider the devices’ implications for everyday life more deeply. One way in which devices are omnipresent is thorough the ability to receive “notifications” via their screens. Through different settings on our phones and tablets we can choose what apps we want to “notify” us with updates or news. Texts and emails can be pushed immediately to the end user on our home screens so that we know immediately when we receive a new message of some sort. Although this may be handy for most, some question how this type of constant access to “notifications” impedes our day and productivity. In my own life, I know that I am always somewhat taken aback when I receive a text notification after midnight from someone. I wonder who possibly thinks that this is ok when the one on the receiving end is sleeping. It seems that when we were in the world of landlines, people were more mindful about when they reached out to give you a call. I think it was rare to get a call on a landline, except in an emergency. Now, however, that barrier of time has broken down; we see another paradigm shift in expectations around communication. People think less about the timing of when they send a text, email or call. It has also been my experience that the response time that is expected with some of these forms of communication is immediate.  Perhaps because the sender expects that you will receive virtually instant notification of the text or email, expectations are heightened that one will respond with great haste. I have received texts from friends who subsequently become upset because I did not respond back immediately. While I experience frustration from these often unspoken expectations, I also question how one person could truly engage another in deep discourse on matters of importance when one is reduced down to size-restricted tweets with the expectation of an immediate reply.  How many arguments would be avoided if everyone had to wait 12 hours before hitting send on an e-mail?The practical ramifications of these communication innovations are becoming increasingly clear.  For example, at a time when vehicle safety has hit an all-time high, there is also a rise in accidents due to inattentive driving caused by checking electronics.  People have a need to check their devices frequently, including when they are behind the wheel of a car. This distraction of mixing texting and driving together causes serious, sometimes deadly consequences. According to the National Safety Council, texting and driving causes 1,600,000 accidents per year and 11 teen deaths every day, often in a matter of seconds. (Online Schools, Unknown)A new device introduced this month is the iWatch. This is a new wearable by Apple that essentially pushes app notifications to a device that you wear on your wrist. Articles already have started to surface questioning if people should be allowed to wear it while they are driving. Since most states ban the use of a smart phone while driving, people are wondering if people should be allowed to use a watch that serves the same purpose. Apple has sold over 1 million watches already and the verdict is unclear if laws will be enacted to ban interactive wearables while driving. Last year the state of California did ban the use of Google Glass while driving, indicating that it is no different a distraction than using a smart phone. (Walter 2015) On the flip side, there are companies that are trying to innovate to replace the hand held screen altogether and make it more of an affordance on the vehicle itself. A company called RayGo has come up with an affordance that attaches to the driver’s steering wheel. This in turn syncs with your bluetooth and smart phone that then allow hands free communication between the devices. It also can sense if you are turning the car or driving fast and will adjust communicating with you under the conditions that the device is experiencing. (Shandrow 2015)The increase in device usage has even impacted one of the simplest tasks known to human-kind, around since we existed on earth: walking. An average observer can note how we have become a society that no longer looks straight ahead when we walk, but rather have become people who look down at our devices, interacting with them during every free moment. There have been news reports of pedestrian injuries on the rise due to a lack of being aware while walking, including a 14 year old boy walking off a 6 foot high bridge to a 23 year old man being hit by a car. (Shaver 2014) Accidents are occurring on a daily basis because we are distracted with the screen and fearful we will miss something important if we put it down. Some say it is the pedestrians that are keeping our emergency rooms in business. The innovations that have driven an ever-increasing array of devices clearly can have both positive qualities and negative ramifications. There are clear benefits to being able to pick up a cell phone, at any time, at any place, and make a call around the world; this would have been merely a dream 30 years ago. Yet, as a society we need to take an assertive role if these technologies end up doing more to divide and distract us than to connect us. If negative patterns and rituals are emerging out of new technologies, then we need to step back and see how we can minimize the impact to indeed make our life simpler, more fulfilling, and connective.

    "body": "2014/07/29 -            Sumary  At Intel Labs I worked on the User Experience Research Group's Open Design Team where I focused on researching how Intel could make hardware more approachable to novice makers. Our goal was to deliver a comprehensive research summary of the   space surrounding Galileo and a final prototype of our recommended solution. Our team conducted a comprehensive research phase focusing on building a comprehensive ecosystem surrounding the Galileo to enable it to become an educational   platform for individuals new to the maker space.         Principles        Collaborative  The product should allow for more than one user at the same time.         Generative  It should multiply the possibilities for making. It should be FUN and spark imagination.         Quick + Rich  It takes away the complexity of building circuits to allow for making. It does not limit the range of creations the maker can build.         Level Up  The system enables the user to advance his/her/their skill level.         Prototypes  We explored a variety of concepts stemming from modular self-building kits to making smarter breadboards that one could control with an app. Ultimately, we narrowed it down to two main streams of thought. One explored the value gained by   reverse engineering something and the second investigated building from scratch in a ‘safe’ environment.                                             Bee      This concept spawned from the idea that many kids will disassemble things as an attempt to understand how they work. To test this hypothesis we built a ‘Bee’ that was constructed of mini modules that can be taken apart and put back       together in a different order to make a new object. For this iteration the Bee’s eyes light up when you touched its wings.                                                     Out of The Box      Next, we explored the ideas surrounding a toolkit that would make it safe to “blow something up” as you learn about the relationships between sensors and actuators. The goal of this concept was to focus on a more guided experience and       to leave the user with a kit of components which they can use to start making their first project.                   The goal of the next iteration was to solidify the proper flow to better understand the best method for introducing the relationship between hardware and software. Similar discoveries arose reflecting that we did not fully resolve the issues   from version 2. This forced us to radically shift the intended flow of our box by turning the box into a mini toolbox and workstation which immediately exposed all the components.             Next we wanted to understand how novice makers experience the relationships between sensors and actuators. We thought this could be achieved through the introduction of a working circuit which could be used as the Galileo booted up. At that   point the next flap of the box would open revealing a collection of different sensors and actuators to exchange with the working circuit. We discovered that there is a preconceived affordance: when kids saw an open box, they wanted to open all   of the flaps at once as opposed to following the sequence of steps that would teach them about sensors and actuators. This instinctive response disrupted the flow of the experience.           The final few versions of the start kit where tested at the YWCA with Kids from 12 years old to 16 years old. During these revisions we focused on expanding what build by kids after they under understood the relationships between sensors and   actuators.       Final Product Deck                                                                                                Update 2017   A few years after finishing this project I saw A similar project come to market from the work of Seeed Studio who has continued to make a series of kits and modular sensors for later development board (Edison and Joule) which  followed Galileo.

    "title": "Data Centers and Dirty Energy",
    "body": "2014/04/30 - William Felker 2014/05/01 1 Data Centers and Dirty Energy Within today’s culture there is an ever-growing awareness of the effect that humans have on the planet. Traditionally this mindset revolves around tangible objects like paper plates, solar energy, and specifically things that we can see or touch. However, there is a gap in awareness specifically around where our online data lives, how it gets to us, and what exactly is powering it. This is a part of a multifaceted problem which includes a lack of consumer awareness as well as the reality that some companies, including a few of the data center giants, are not willing to adhere to any form of power or data conservation plan. The society in which we live has changed drastically in the last few years on how we interact with digital devices, shop online, search the web for information or socialize through different social media outlets. The digital data that we are using has increased exponentially. In August of 2013, Americans spent more time using digital media than actually watching television. The average time a person spends online everyday is 5 hours. The device that Americans are using the most to interact with this digital data is the mobile phone. (“Digital Set to Surpass TV in Time Spent with US Media. ”) Every time we use the internet to access this type of data it travels through data centers, which are where information that we are accessing is processed, stored and then acts as a portal for sending out the data to the end user. A simple task of sending a photograph via email is a task that takes a journey through hundreds of networks until it reaches the data center and then arrives at the end user. (Glanz, James. “Power, Pollution and the Internet. ”) There is also much debate about how we are going to progress in this industry with all the cable that exists between data centers and consumers. The cable lines that connect the data centers to ultimately the end user are also in question. The technology is progressing at such a rapid pace that the cables become bottlenecks for William Felker  2 2014/05/01information to travel through almost as fast as they are updated. One solution that companies like Microsoft are trying is to transport information through wireless technology by applying wireless links on top of server racks. (Eisenberg, Anne. “A Wireless Road Around Data Traffic Jams. ” The New York Times) These tens of thousands of data centers hold vast amounts of information, but also produce large amounts of energy waste and most are horrible for the environment. These data centers consume worldwide about 30 billion watts of electricity and often waste up to 90 percent of the electricity that they use. The United States uses the most data center power in the world. (Cook, Gary. “. ” . N. p. , n. d. Web. 29 Apr. 2014) Today’s consumers want immediate access to the internet 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, with zero time off from accessibility which is just driving this problem further. Companies cannot risk losing customers by not allowing the consumer constant access to information they want. This causes the data centers to use extreme amounts of electricity, along with back up systems in case of electrical failure which consist of generators and lead-acid batteries. To add more fuel to the fire, the data center industry has no government agency that regulates them or their usage of electricity. Since most data that a user accesses is personal, many data centers are set up where they are in unmarked buildings or protected due to the end user’s privacy and therefore total data usage cannot be tracked. The New York Times investigated data center energy usage and discovered that even “the federal government was unable to determine how much energy its own data centers consume”. (Glanz, James. “Power, Pollution and the Internet. ”) The EPA however estimates that the government data centers use consume 10% of energy in the U. S. (“Data Centers and Energy Efficiency. ” Alliance to Save Energy. N. p. , n. d. ) It is expected that between 2012 - 2017, data use will triple from 44 to 121 exabytes. To put this number in perspective one exabyte equals one billion gigabytes. (“What is an Exabyte (EB)? - Definition from Techopedia. ” Techopedias) The main cause of this expected growth is due to consumers’ usage of video and William Felker  3 2014/05/01audio streaming. Half of internet traffic in the US today is generated by using Netflix and YouTube, with YouTube being the biggest company that generates data. (Cook, Gary. “. ” . N. p. , n. d. Web. 29 Apr. 2014) The increase in consumer ownership of tablets and smart phones are also the problem: “Although charging up a single tablet or smart phone requires a negligible amount of electricity, using either to watch an hour of video weekly consumes annually more electricity in the remote networks than two new refrigerators use in a year”, says the National Mining Association and the American Coalition for Clean Coal Energy. (“IT now 10 percent of world’s electricity consumption, report finds. ” • The Register) This is almost an incomprehensible amount of energy consumption that most consumers are not aware of as an issue. As an awareness grows regarding data centers and energy consumption, so does the knowledge regarding what companies are the biggest culprits in this consumption. Twitter, Amazon, Digital Reality, and Dupont are among the worst. Amazon, which retains a large part of the internet usage market, is one of the biggest culprits of dirty energy. They also do not report any information regarding its footprint to anyone. (Cook, Gary. “. ” . N. p. , n. d. Web. 29 Apr. 2014) Some of these data centers work for other major companies which help this “dirty energy” secret grow. Dupont, for example, is a data center that is one of the biggest in the US which works for companies like Zynga, Microsoft, Yahoo and Dropbox. Amazon is another giant powerhouse that works with Yelp, Pinterest, Netflix, Vine, Airbnb, Tumblr, Vimeo and Spotify, just to name a few. One can easily see how this consumption problem keeps growing as these companies are being spun together in a data center web. (Your Online World: #ClickClean or Dirty?. ” Greenpeace) Most of these companies use a form of nuclear power and/or coal which is horrible for the environment. On the flip side of this energy consumption crisis, there are companies which are trying to change the ways in which they run their data centers. Currently companies like Ebay, IBM, Telecity and Equinix fall somewhere in the middle of this energy crisis taking steps to make William Felker  4 2014/05/01small changes that lead to big ones. Ebay is a popular consumer brand which is behind other companies its size for innovation but is making changes within the company to change over to renewable energy and lower its overall energy consumption. (“Your Online World: #ClickClean or Dirty?. ” Greenpeace) The companies that are taking a commitment in using 100% renewable energy in the data center realm are Apple, Google and Facebook. These companies are also allowing for total transparency as they try to meet this goal. An action step that Facebook is taking is having a data center in Iowa being powered by wind turbines. This makes Facebook the largest purchaser of turbines worldwide. The company also built an energy efficient data center in Oregon which reduced energy consumption by 38% compared to its other facilities. (“Data Centers and Energy Efficiency. ” Alliance to Save Energy) Google is also an innovator by working together with its vendors to expand renewable energy to create a green internet. The goal of these companies is to switch to solar and wind power and make the need for coal, nuclear and gas power obsolete. (Cook, Gary. “. ” . N. p. , n. d. Web. 29 Apr. 2014) One company in particular that is getting many accolades is Apple. Within just a two year period they have worked passionately to eliminate all nuclear, coal and natural gas from their centers and earned a perfect score of 100 percent by Greenpeace. Apple is using solar, wind, and geothermal plants in place of other dirty forms of energy. The company is also being totally transparent which hopefully will help other companies be motivated to change. (“Your Online World: #ClickClean or Dirty?. ” Greenpeace. ) Educating the consumer about this dirty energy secret will hopefully catapult and pressure companies and government to change and encourage consumers to think about their digital habits and make changes as well. When searching the internet on this issue one can find consumer advocacy blogs popping up exposing and educating other consumers about the companies which are contributing to this dirty energy problem. On the ethical consumer blog, William Felker  5 2014/05/01they reference a Greenpeace article stating, “Those companies, most notably Amazon Web Services, are choosing how to power their infrastructure based solely on lowest electricity prices, without consideration to the impact their growing electricity footprints have on human health or the environment. ” (“Story of the Day Index - Amazon criticised for dirty data services. ” Story of the Day Index) It is articles and blogs like the ethical consumer that will help spread the word on this dirty energy crisis and create change. A big thanks to Greenpeace which has been a major contributor in trying to educate consumers about this growing problem by providing hard data about a wide range of companies.

          <p>This year my focus has shifted to doing projects that amplify my learning and help me rebuild my creative confidence. In the spirit of this I have bene looking at setting up a small online store and wanted to research what some of the best options are for indie makers.</p>

<p>From what I can tell the best starting points are <a href="">Zeits VPRS</a> and <a href="">ZipSell</a>. Partly because they both use Stripe, and they are both pretty quick to get working if you have some technical experience. But if want to use a GUI the entire way the Small Victories is a reasobable starting pint.</p>
