I work with organizations to research the humans at the center of their products and services. This has lead to me working at research labs within companies for the past few years.

Currently, I'm shifting my focus to regaining my cognitive and creative freedom as an [#IndieMaker](). This means that instead of treating personal projects as side projects they will be what I dedicate my time to daily.

Enter, [Tiny Factories](https://tinyfactories.space) a tribe of indie makers helping each other to ship products.


Some recent project that I launched are:

- OOAK


- Component Guide


- Timy Factoiers


- Oh Dot Zero
